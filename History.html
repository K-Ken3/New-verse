        <h2>Coffee</h2>
        <p>The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in modern-day Somalia,
            Ethiopia and Yemen. It was already known in Mecca in the 15th century. Also, in the 15th century,
             Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers.
             [1] Coffee later spread to the Levant in the early 16th century; 
             it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society.
              Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes,
               while Central and Eastern Europeans learned of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century,
                it had reached India and the East Indies.</p>

           Coffee houses were established in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in Holland, England, and Germany.
            One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720.
             These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands such as Saint-Domingue
              and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.[citation needed]</p>
           
           <p>By 1852, Brazil became the world's largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since.
            The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field owing to the emergence of several other major producers,
             notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the
              second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it
               a household item today.</p>

               <p>Coffee drinks are made by brewing water with ground coffee beans.
                The brewing is either done slowly by drip, filter, French press, moka pot or percolator, or done very quickly
                 under pressure by an espresso machine. When put under the pressure of an espresso machine,
                  the coffee is termed espresso while slow-brewed coffees are generally termed brewed coffee.
                   While all coffee drinks are based on either coffee or espresso, some drinks add milk or cream,
                    some are made with steamed milk or non-dairy milks, or add water (like the americano).
                     Upon milk additions, coffee's flavor can vary with different syrups or sweeteners, alcoholic liqueurs, and
                      even combinations of coffee with espresso or tea.[1] There are many variations to the basic coffee or
                       espresso bases.</p>

                    <p>The history of tea in China is long and complex,
                     for the Chinese have enjoyed tea for millennia.
                      Scholars hailed the brew as a cure for a variety of ailments;
                       the nobility considered the consumption of good tea as a mark of their status,
                        and the common people simply enjoyed its flavour. In 2016, the discovery of the earliest known
                         physical evidence of tea from the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han (d. 141 BCE)
                          in Xi'an was announced, indicating that tea from the genus Camellia was drunk by Han dynasty
                           emperors as early as the 2nd century BCE.[1] Tea then became a popular drink in the Tang
                            (618–907) and Song (960–1279) dynasties.</p>

                    <p>A snack is a small portion of food generally eaten between meals.[1] A snack is often less than 200[2] calories, but this can vary.
                     Snacks come in a variety of forms including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made
                      from fresh ingredients at home.</p>

                    <p>Traditionally, snacks are prepared from ingredients commonly available at home without a great deal of preparation.
                     Often cold cuts, fruits, leftovers, nuts, sandwiches, and sweets are used as snacks. With the spread of convenience
                      stores, packaged snack foods became a significant business.</p>
                    
                    <p>Snack foods are typically designed to be portable, quick, and satisfying. Processed snack foods, as one form of convenience food,
                     are designed to be less perishable, more durable, and more portable than prepared foods. They often contain
                      substantial amounts of sweeteners, preservatives, and appealing ingredients such as chocolate, peanuts,
                       and specially designed flavors (such as flavored potato chips). Aside from the use of additives, the viability of
                        packaging so that food quality can be preserved without degradation is also important for commercialization</p>
